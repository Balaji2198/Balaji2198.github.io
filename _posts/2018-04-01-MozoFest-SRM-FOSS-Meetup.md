MOZOFEST is an annual Three day Open Source Tech Fest. This year it happened 
at 22nd-24th March 2018 conducted by SRMKZILLA (Mozilla Campus Club).The 
main objective of the fest was to spread more awareness about the Mozilla 
Community also about the open source technologies. 

These 3 days were full of Hackathons, Workshops on Rust and WebVR and 
the talks on various intresting topics in [SRM FOSS Meetup](https://
reps.mozilla.org/e/srmkzilla-s-mozofest-18/). I gave a talk on "Opening upto 
Open Source". Here is the gist of my talk

<blockquote>
This talk gives a complete overview of how to contribute to open source. It 
covers a various ways of contributing to open source softwares and how to 
involve with the open source communities. This talk also covers a quick Hands-on 
session on Open source technologies like Git and Github Work flow and how to 
start submit your first patch.
</blockquote>

There were a different sessions going on simultaneously at the same time. 
The wide range of diverse topics are

* Data Science
* Security
* Muifactor Authentication
* Block Chain
* Ansible Automation, etc

Participats were really enjoyed attending the different sessions on Open Source Technologies.

It was a great experience for me. I was happy to see Viswaprasath, Mehul patel, 
Dinesh, Karthikeyan, Jayesh and all the other Mozilla reps and Mozillians. I was young 
among all of them. So I am privileged that I got to 
talk and interact with those Amazing peoples also I have learnt a lot from them.
