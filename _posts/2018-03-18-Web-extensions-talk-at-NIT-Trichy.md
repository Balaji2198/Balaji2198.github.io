Recently I was invited to deliver a talk on “How to build a Web-Extensions?” at 
NIT Trichy, one of the prestigious institution in India on 10th March 2018. I was 
really excited and honoured to give a talk there. My entire 
approach towards this talk was to pitch in more about How to get started with 
Web-Extensions and give a hands-on session on it.

The session was two part (First is Introduction to Mozilla community and then second 
part is getting started with Web Extensions.). The event started of with the Barani 
by explaining students about Mozilla mission and contribution path to 
Mozilla(Webextensions, webVR, webCompat, MDN, Rust). Also he gave 
a brief overview about Quality Assurence and how he is contributing.

After the Barani's session I started of with "Introduction to Web extension" 
session.Then I explained them about Webextensions, why we moved from SDK to 
webextensions, students loved the concept of portability. Participants was intrested 
to know about how does the same code runs seamlessly as Firefox extension as well as 
Chrome extension. This for sure raised the interest of the students. They are 
impressed by the concept of **"Write once and run anywhere."**

Then after giving a basic overview and Anatomy of the Web extensions. I explained 
them various **webextensions API**, and how they can use them to modify 
functionalities of the browser, students were pretty enthusiastic to know the ease of 
development.

Then the Hands-on session started. I expalined the codeflow and walked them through 
the each line of code of **"chrome_url_overrides"**. We (Me and Barani) helped the 
participants to Debug the extension and helped the students to run their extensions
on their laptop  and cleared their doubts. One of the participant was very much 
interested to know about the **Tabs API** and asked the lot 
of doubts based on it. I was happy to answer those questions and explained him 
clearly about the Tabs API.

Then I showed them how to port same extension to chrome and they were shocked to see the Same code worked on chrome like a charm.
