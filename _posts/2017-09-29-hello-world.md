Hello World. This is my first post on this blog. I always wanted to have a website of my own so that I could express myself in my own ways. And here today  I finally got my website live on the Internet. Lot more crazy stuffs will be posted here. 


I believe being busy is the best way to learn new things, manage time and build up yourself.
I am that person who believes nothing is impossible provided there is time, dedication and passion to work towards it.

In this blog, you can expect to find a log of all my technical and rarely, non-technical work. I will try to keep this blog active. Oh, Did I tell you I am just an amateur blogger? That means, I am very open to suggestions and will reply to almost all of the suggestions/criticism you inbox me.

Stay tuned. Let's start the journey..
